    <h2>Learning New Technologies</h2>
    <p>
        My favorite hobby is learning new technologies.
        I enjoy exploring emerging tools, programming languages and software platforms that enhance my technical
        knowledge and problem solving abilities.
        As an MCA student staying updated with the latest trends in technology helps me strengthen my foundation and
        remain competitive in the IT field.
        I often spend my free time watching tutorials, reading tech blogs and practicing new concepts through small
        projects.
        This hobby not only improves my technical skills but also keeps me curious, adaptable and motivated to grow
        continuously in my career.
